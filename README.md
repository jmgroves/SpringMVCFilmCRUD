# SpringMVCFilmCRUD

This project was an exercise in learning how to route the paths correctly to call updates to a database from a webform.


#Description

This project revolves around a CRUD application with a relational database in MySQL. Users are able to view film details in the database from the webforms, update, destroy and other fun things. We use SpringMVC and gradle to handle the framework aspects of this. 


#Technologies

We used quite a few technologies on this project. From SpringMVC to Gradle, to deploying on AWS and using a tomcat server locally. Java handled the logic. HTML/CSS for the presentation and function on the website side. MySQL was used for the relational database. 

#Challenges

Figuring out how to pass objects from the database and throughout the database was tricky, but a good learning experience. The biggest help to figuring out how to pass items was to use system.out's to figure out what exactly was being passed as we would find that we were not always passing the correct item the first time through.
