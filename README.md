# THIS PROJECT. THIS FREAKIN PROJECT.

This project was an exercise in frustration and learning. Learning how to route the paths correctly to call updates to a database from a webform that was being called from somewhere else was something I wouldn't wish on an enemy.


#Description

This project revolves around a CRUD application with a relational database in MySQL. Users are able to view film details in the database from the webforms, update, destroy and other fun things. We use SpringMVC and gradle to handle the framework aspects of this. 


#Technologies

We used quite a few technologies on this project. From SpringMVC to Gradle, to deploying on AWS and usomg a tomcat server locally. Programming mostly done in Java as far as logic. HTML/CSS for some stylish pinash and actually clickable buttons that do real internet things. MySQL for the relational database. 

#Challenges

We learned very quickly that we were not as good as we thought we were. Pathing objects through the mystical land of SpringMVC and trying to figure out why or why not things are working was probably our biggest challenge. As rough as it was, we definitely learned a WHOOOOLE lot about how to create and deploy dynamic web applications.
